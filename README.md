EigneToken is the official currency for the Eigne platform.Eigne is a decentralized market and streaming platform where musical artists and producers can sell musical projects or singles as NFT.It was designed to reward long-term holders and charges sellers a few percent fee, with part of that fee going back to existing holders.Like other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, EigneToken is powered by Binance Smart Chain.

This is the future of the music industry, we are building a platform that will allow our users to purchase musical NFT using our native token $EIT. Our platform will allow holders of our $EIT token to purchase musical NFT and stream music while earning rewards.We added a new ecosystem that overcomes transactional complexities and outrageous fees and sustains fairness and privacy for all users.Music gives color to the air of the moment like this EigneToken gives color to the crypto investors.

The freeze and mint authority are both disabled for the token. There are no specific breakdowns for allotments for the EigneToken. 100% of the tokens can and will be used for various things at various times. If there is ever a need to be more specific and have a rigid breakdown of the token, that can be added at a later date.All transaction on the platform will use the native eigne token $EIT
